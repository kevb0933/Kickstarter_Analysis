# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
To help Louise start a croundfunding campain in order to begin funding her new play.

## Analysis and Challenges
Found challenges with organizing the data provided by Louise. Proceeded to create new columns to seperate grouped categories into seperate columns making the data clear and easier to read.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The outcomes based on the launch date had shown that the months of April, May, June, July, and August had the highest failed result in theater. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The outcomes based on goals to be reached showed on avergae between 20%-60% successful plays whithin the $20,000-$35,000 range.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The most challenging part of this project and also most difficult, would be making sure all data has be transfered to the charts correctly as well as making sure the proper formulas were entered.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Found there to be a higher failure rate than successful outcomes for just theater alone.
Was able to see that theater performed worst when released during the middle of the year (may-aug).

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Found that the percentage of successful and percentage of failed would be opposite of one anoher. Between 20% and 80%, there were 3 times that 50% failed and successful outcomes were found.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Limitations could be that the data is not current. Most of the data provided shows to be several years old and without current data it will be hard to say for sure if her style of play will be successful and within her budget.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could create more graphs like how much of this data was produced in the US or we could create a graph based on staf_picks vs category which would help show what most are interested in.
